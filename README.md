# koibots-2022
Hey guys, this year lets try to stick to a couple different conventions for how we code to keep things simple and understandable for everybody. First of all check the important links, especially the conventions for variable naming, inconsistient variable naming generates confusion. You should also check out the link about how to write your git commit messages though we are only going to focus on the first line of the commit. Keeping a detailed commit history makes refering back to code and finding errors further in the future easier. Lastly check out the game resources and read through the manual. I'll update this readme and list as neccissary.
